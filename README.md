Repository for the code that was originally written by another user for custom layouts on https://cytu.be/.

This layout supports the toggling of "cinema mode" which is activated by clicking the little button in the top right corner of the page or with the dropdown menu item.

Some minor additions and fixes have been applied by me on top of the existing code for a more tailored experience at https://cytu.be/r/Badmovies_marathon.
